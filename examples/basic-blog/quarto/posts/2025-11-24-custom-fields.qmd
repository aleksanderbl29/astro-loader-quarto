# Custom Fields

This post includes custom fields that can be mapped and used in your Astro site.

## Custom Metadata

- **Reading Time**: 5 minutes
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

These custom fields can be:

1. Passed through with their original names
2. Mapped to different names in your Astro configuration
3. Used in filters and transforms
4. Validated with custom schemas

## Example Configuration

```typescript
const blog = defineCollection({
  loader: quartoLoader({
    quartoRoot: './quarto',
    listings: 'blog-posts',
    fieldMappings: {
      'reading-time': 'readingMinutes',
      'difficulty': 'level',
    }
  })
});
```

Now your Astro pages can access these as `readingMinutes` and `level`!
