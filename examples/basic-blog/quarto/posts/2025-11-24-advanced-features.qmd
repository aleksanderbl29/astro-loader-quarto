# Advanced Features

This post demonstrates some advanced features of the Astro + Quarto integration.

## Multiple Authors

Notice this post has multiple authors, which is automatically handled by the loader.

## Field Mapping

The loader automatically maps Quarto fields to Astro conventions:

- `date` → `pubDate`
- `date-modified` → `updatedDate`
- `image` → `heroImage`

## Code Examples

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from Quarto!")
```

## Math Support

When rendered by Quarto, you can include mathematical notation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

## Callouts

::: {.callout-note}
This is a Quarto callout block that will be rendered when you run `quarto render`.
